    "## Caching\n",

    "The Panel architecture ensures that multiple user sessions can run in the same process and therefore have access to the same global state. This means that we can cache data in Panel's global `state` object, either by directly assigning to the `pn.state.cache` dictionary object or by using the `pn.state.as_cached` helper function.\n",

    "    pn.state.cache['data'] = data = ... # Load some data or perform an expensive computation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `as_cached` helper function on the other hand allows providing a custom key and a function and automatically caching the return value. If provided the `args` and `kwargs` will also be hashed making it easy to cache (or memoize) on the arguments to the function: \n",

If you want to warm up the cache before the first user visits the application you can also provide the `--warm` argument to the `panel serve` command, which will ensure the application is initialized once on launch."

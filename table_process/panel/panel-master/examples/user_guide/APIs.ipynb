    "## Interact Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``interact`` function will automatically generate a UI (including widgets) by inspecting the arguments of the function given to it, or by using additional hints you provide in the ``interact`` function call. If you have worked with the [``ipywidgets``](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) package you may already be familiar with this approach. (In fact, the Panel interact function is modeled on the one from ipywidgets, making it simpler to port code between the two platforms.) The basic idea is that given a function that returns some object, Panel will inspect the arguments to that function, try to infer appropriate widgets for those arguments, and then re-run that function to update the output whenever one of the widgets generates an event. For more detail on how interact creates widgets and other ways of using it, see the Panel [interact user guide](./interact.ipynb).  This section instead focuses on when and why to use this API, laying out its benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of this approach is convenience and ease of use.  You start by writing some function that returns an object, be that a plot, a dataframe, or anything else that Panel can render. Then with a single call to `pn.interact()`, you can immediately get an interactive UI, without ever instantiating any widgets or wiring up any callbacks explicitly. Unlike ipywidgets, the ``pn.interact`` call will return a Panel. This Panel can then be further modified by laying out the widgets and output separately, or combining these components with other panes. Even though `pn.interact` itself is limited in flexibility compared to the rest of Panel, you can still unpack and reconfigure the results from it to generate fairly complex GUIs in very little code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Easy to use (or at least easy to get started!).\n",
    "+ Doesn't typically require modifying existing visualization code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of the behavior is implicit, with magic happening by introspection, making it difficult to see how to modify the appearance or functionality of the resulting object.\n",
    "- Customizing the layout requires indexing into the panel returned by `interact`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest `interact` call can be a one-liner, but here we'll show an example of intermediate complexity so that you get a good idea of what `interact` can do in practice. In this code, ``pn.interact`` infers the initial value for `x` and `y` from the `autompg_plot` function default arguments and their widget type and range from the `columns` list provided to `interact`. `interact` wouldn't normally put up a color widget because it would have no way of knowing that this string-type argument represents an RGB color, and so here we explicitly create a color-picker widget and pass that as the value for the color so that we can control the color as well. Finally, we unpack the result from `interact` and rearrange it in a different layout with a title, to create the final app. See the Panel [interact user guide](./interact.ipynb) for even simpler examples along with details about how to control the widgets and how to rearrange the layout."

Specifying those aspects explicitly provides more power and control, but does typically take a bit more code and more knowledge of widget and layout components than using `interact` does.

This approach allows the parameters controlling some computation to be captured specifically and explicitly (but as abstract parameters, not as widgets). Then thanks to the ``@param.depends`` decorator (similar to `@panel.depends` but for use in Parameterized classes without any dependency on Panel), it is then possible to directly express the dependencies between the parameters and the computation defined in some method on the class, all without ever importing Panel or any other GUI library. The resulting objects can then be used in both GUI and non-GUI contexts (batch computations, scripts, servers).\n",

    "\n",
    "As we have seen, each of these four APIs allows building the same basic application. The choice of the appropriate API depends very much on the use case. To build a quick throwaway GUI the ``interact`` approach can be completely sufficient. A much more explicit, flexible, and maintainable version of that approach is to define a reactive function that is bound directly to a set of widgets using `pn.bind`. When writing libraries or other code that might be used independently of the actual GUI, a Parameterized class can be a great way to organize the code. Finally, if you need low-level control or want to complement any of the other approaches, defining explicit callbacks can be the best approach. Nearly all of the functionality of Panel can be accessed using any of the APIs, but each makes certain things much easier than others. Choosing the API is therefore a matter of considering the tradeoffs and of course also a matter of preference. If you still aren't sure after reading the above, then just go with the `pn.bind` reactive API!"
